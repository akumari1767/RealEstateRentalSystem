# RealEstateRentalSystem

Project Scope:

	Our Real Estate Rental System will be a single platform to List the available rental properties to prospective Customers. The platform will be developed using Python programming language and will be using SQLite database for data storage purposes.

Business Rules:

The System will allow recording data about the building available for rent like the size of the apartment, which floor the property is in, rental cost, availability and so on.

The System will allow capturing the Tenant Information like Name, Email, Phone, and so on.

The System will allow the Tenant to choose an available property for rent and then calculate the rental cost based on the start and end time of the rental chosen by the tenant.

The System allows monthly payment of rent by the tenant.

The System allows staff users to extract reports in form of tables or create graphs from the DB.

All records on the system will allow audit (Storage in SQLite)

Report Types:

The application allows reports to be generated, reports might include visual elements like graphs, charts, etc. sample reports like:

	(1) Due Amounts by Customer
	(2) Number of apartments booked in each building
	(3) Number of bookings after a particular date
	(4) Apartment details of a particular building
